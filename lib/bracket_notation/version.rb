# BracketNotation is a parser for generating syntax trees from sentences
# annotated with the kind of bracket notation that is commonly used by
# linguists. The result is a tree structure with nodes that describe the phrases
# and constituents of the sentence.
#
# BracketNotation was inspired by Yoichiro Hasebe's RSyntaxTree[http://yohasebe.com/rsyntaxtree/],
# and small portions of his code have been incorporated in the parser.
